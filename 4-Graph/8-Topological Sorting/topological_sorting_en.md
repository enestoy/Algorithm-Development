# Topological Sorting

Topological sorting is a sorting algorithm that can only be applied to a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**. This algorithm is used to arrange the nodes of a graph while respecting the direction of each edge.

## Key Concepts

- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: A graph with edges that does not form a cycle is called a DAG.
- **Topological Sorting**: The nodes in a DAG are arranged such that for every edge, the starting node appears before the ending node in the order. In other words, a node can only be sorted after all the nodes it depends on have been sorted.

### Key Steps

1. **Select the Starting Node**: Independent nodes (i.e., nodes with no incoming edges) are initially sorted.
2. **Sort Nodes**: After the independent node is sorted, the process continues with its dependent nodes, and all edges leading from them are removed.
3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until all nodes are sorted.

### Example

In a school, certain courses need to be taken in a specific order. For example, to take Mathematics, Physics must be taken first. **Topological sorting** is used for such dependency problems.

### Important Features

- **No Cycles**: Topological sorting can only be applied to acyclic graph structures. If the graph contains a cycle, topological sorting is not possible.
- **Multiple Results Possible**: If the graph contains independent subgraphs, there may be multiple valid topological sorting orders.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of topological sorting is generally **O(V + E)**, where V represents the number of vertices (nodes) and E represents the number of edges.

### Applications

- **Dependency Solutions**: Used in software compilation, task scheduling, or ordering dependent operations.
- **Database Updates**: When data in a database needs to be updated in a specific order.
- **Directed Trees and Graphs**: Used in task management and process scheduling.

### Algorithm Pseudocode

1. Select the independent nodes at the start.
2. Sort the independent nodes and remove the edges connected to them.
3. Check the remaining nodes and add new independent nodes.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes are sorted.

### Advantages

- Simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm.
- Correctly determines the order of dependent tasks.

### Disadvantages

- Only works on **acyclic** graph structures and cannot handle cyclic graphs.
- While efficient, the processing time may increase for large graph structures.

Topological sorting is an important algorithm, especially when tasks need to be performed in a specific order.
