# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to solve the **maximum flow** problem. This algorithm aims to find the highest possible flow from the **source** node to the **sink** node in a directed flow network.

## Key Concepts

- **Flow Network**: A directed graph consisting of nodes and edges, where each edge has a capacity.
- **Maximum Flow**: The maximum amount of data that can flow from the source to the sink along a path.
- **Residual Flow Path**: A path from the source to the sink that still has capacity available.

### Basic Steps

1. **Initial State**: The flow starts at zero.
2. **Find Residual Flow Path**: A path with remaining capacity between the source and sink is found (usually using **DFS** or **BFS**).
3. **Update Flow**: The flow on the found path is increased based on the edge capacities.
4. **Repeat Steps 2 and 3**: Repeat the process until no more residual flow paths can be found.
5. **Result**: The algorithm terminates when no residual flow paths are found, and the total flow value is returned.

### Example

In a water pipeline network, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can be used to determine the capacity of water flowing from the source to the sink. Since each pipe has a capacity, the algorithm calculates the maximum amount of water that can be efficiently transported.

### Important Features

- **BFS or DFS Usage**: The residual flow path finding process is typically done using either depth-first search or breadth-first search.
- **Flow Value**: In each iteration, the flow is increased by the capacity of the path.
- **Time Complexity**: If DFS is used, the time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is generally O(E * F), where E is the number of edges and F is the maximum flow.

### Applications

- **Network Flow Problems**: Situations where resources like water, electricity, or data need to be transported through networks.
- **Communication Network Planning**: Ensuring data is transmitted through networks in the most efficient way.
- **Cumulative Flow Analysis**: Used in various engineering and scientific fields to calculate maximum flow.

### Algorithm Pseudocode

1. Initially, set the flow of each edge to zero.
2. Find a residual flow path (using DFS or BFS).
3. Find the capacity of the residual flow path and increase the flow by that amount.
4. Update the path and repeat step 2.
5. When no residual flow paths can be found, return the total flow.

### Advantages

- Efficiently calculates the maximum flow.
- Applicable to large networks and complex structures.

### Disadvantages

- The algorithm can be inefficient in some edge cases, and the residual path finding time may increase.
- The computation time can be long for very large networks.

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is especially important for optimizing data transmission and transportation capacities in networked systems.
