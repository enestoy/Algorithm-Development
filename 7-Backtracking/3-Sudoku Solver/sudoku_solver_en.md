# Sudoku Solver with Backtracking Algorithm

## Problem Definition

Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that:

- Each row contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- Each column contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- Each of the 9 subgrids (3x3 sections) contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Given a partially filled grid, the objective is to complete the puzzle.

## Backtracking Approach

Backtracking is a technique that solves problems by trying all possible solutions and rejecting those that fail to meet the constraints. In the case of Sudoku, we try placing numbers in empty cells and backtrack if the current choice leads to an invalid configuration.

### Steps to Solve the Sudoku Puzzle using Backtracking

1. **Start with the first empty cell**: Identify the first empty cell (a cell that is not filled with a number).
2. **Try placing a number**: Try placing numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty cell.
3. **Check the constraints**: After placing a number, check if it violates the Sudoku rules:
    - The number must not appear in the same row.
    - The number must not appear in the same column.
    - The number must not appear in the same 3x3 subgrid.
4. **If valid, move to the next empty cell**: If the current placement is valid, move to the next empty cell and repeat the process.
5. **Backtrack if necessary**: If placing a number leads to an invalid configuration (either due to row, column, or subgrid violations), backtrack by removing the last placed number and trying the next possible number for that cell.
6. **Repeat the process**: Continue this process recursively, trying all possible placements for the empty cells.
7. **Solution found**: If all cells are filled in such a way that no rule is violated, the Sudoku puzzle is solved.

## Conclusion

Backtracking is an efficient method for solving Sudoku puzzles. It systematically explores all possible placements for numbers, checking the constraints at each step, and backtracking when necessary to find a valid solution.
