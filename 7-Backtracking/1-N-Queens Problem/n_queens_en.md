# N-Queens Problem with Backtracking Algorithm

## Problem Definition

The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words:

- No two queens can share the same row.
- No two queens can share the same column.
- No two queens can share the same diagonal.

## Backtracking Approach

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems by incrementally building candidates to the solution. If a candidate is found to violate the constraints, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries another candidate.

### Steps to Solve the N-Queens Problem using Backtracking

1. **Start from the first row**: Place a queen in the first row, then move to the next row and repeat.
2. **Column constraint**: For each row, place the queen in a column such that no other queen is already placed in that column.
3. **Diagonal constraint**: Ensure that no other queen is placed on the same diagonal as the current queen.
4. **Backtrack if necessary**: If a valid position for a queen cannot be found in a row, backtrack by removing the last placed queen and trying a new position for it in the previous row.
5. **Repeat the process**: Continue placing queens row by row until all queens are placed on the board.
6. **Solution found**: Once all queens are placed without violating the constraints, the arrangement is a valid solution.
7. **Explore all possible solutions**: The algorithm continues until all potential solutions are explored.

## Conclusion

The Backtracking algorithm is effective for solving the N-Queens problem by methodically trying all possible placements and "backtracking" when it encounters an invalid configuration. This ensures that all potential solutions are considered while maintaining constraints.
