# Subset Sum Problem with Backtracking Algorithm

## Problem Definition

The Subset Sum Problem is a decision problem in which you are given a set of integers and a target sum. The objective is to determine if there exists a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the target sum.

### Example

Given the set of integers `{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}` and a target sum `9`, the subset `{4, 5}` has a sum of `9`, so the answer is "Yes."

## Backtracking Approach

Backtracking is a technique used to find all solutions to a problem by exploring potential candidates and abandoning them as soon as it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid solution.

### Steps to Solve the Subset Sum Problem using Backtracking

1. **Start with the first element**: Start by considering the first element of the set.
2. **Include or exclude the element**: For each element, you have two choices:
    - **Include the element**: Add it to the current subset and reduce the target sum by the value of that element.
    - **Exclude the element**: Simply move to the next element without including it in the subset.
3. **Check if the sum is equal to the target**: If the sum of the current subset equals the target, you have found a solution.
4. **Backtrack if necessary**: If at any point the sum exceeds the target or if you have exhausted all elements without finding a solution, backtrack by undoing the last inclusion and trying the next possible element.
5. **Repeat the process**: Continue this process recursively, considering all possible combinations of elements.
6. **Solution found**: If a valid subset is found, return "Yes". If no valid subset exists after considering all possibilities, return "No".

## Conclusion

The Backtracking algorithm is a powerful tool for solving the Subset Sum Problem. It explores all possible combinations of the set's elements and checks if any of them sum up to the target value, efficiently abandoning impossible paths along the way.
