# Heap Sort

**Heap Sort** is a sorting algorithm that uses the **heap** data structure. A **heap** is a special type of binary tree where each nodeâ€™s value is greater than (max heap) or smaller than (min heap) its children's values. Heap Sort efficiently sorts large datasets using this structure.

## Working Principle of the Algorithm

1. **Building the Heap**:
   - The given array is first converted into a **heap**.
   - The array is transformed into a **max heap** or **min heap**.
   - **Max Heap**: Every parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
   - **Min Heap**: Every parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.

2. **Removing the Root Element**:
   - The largest (or smallest) element is removed from the heap.
   - The root of the heap holds the largest element, which is placed at the end of the array.

3. **Reorganizing the Heap**:
   - To maintain the heap structure, the remaining elements are restructured into a valid heap.

4. **Repeating the Process**:
   - The process continues until all elements are sorted.

## Step-by-Step Example

Array: `[4, 10, 3, 5, 1]`

1. **Converting to a Max Heap**:
   - The array is rearranged into a max heap: `[10, 5, 3, 4, 1]`
   
2. **Removing the Largest Element**:
   - The largest element (10) is removed from the heap and placed at the end: `[1, 5, 3, 4]`
   - The heap is restructured: `[5, 4, 3, 1]`

3. **Repeating the Process**:
   - The next largest element is removed, placed at the end, and the heap is restructured: `[4, 1, 3]`
   - The final sorted array: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 10]`

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n log n)
- **Average Case**: O(n log n)
- **Worst Case**: O(n log n)

Since **Heap Sort** always runs in **O(n log n)** time complexity, it is highly efficient, especially in scenarios where **memory efficiency is crucial** and **extra space usage must be minimal**.

## Advantages

- **Consistent performance**: Always runs in **O(n log n)** time complexity.
- **In-place sorting**: Requires no additional memory (space complexity is O(1)).
- **Not a stable sort**: Equal elements may not retain their original order.

## Disadvantages

- **Unstable sorting**: Heap Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same value may have their order changed.
- **Slower compared to Quick Sort**: Although it has the same time complexity as Quick Sort, heap construction and restructuring operations make it slightly slower.
