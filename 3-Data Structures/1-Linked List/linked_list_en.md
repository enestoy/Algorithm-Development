# What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a dynamic data structure in which each element contains data and a pointer to the next element. This structure is designed as an alternative to static structures like arrays to use memory efficiently.

## Basic Elements of a Linked List

1. **Node:**
    - **Data:** The value stored in the node.
    - **Next:** A pointer that references the next node.

2. **Head:**
    - A pointer referencing the first node of the list.

3. **Tail:**
    - Typically, the last node in the list.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points only to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node.

## Linked List Operations

1. **Insertion:**
    - Adding a new node at the beginning, middle, or end.
2. **Deletion:**
    - Removing a specific node.
3. **Search:**
    - Finding a specific value.
4. **Traversal:**
    - Iterating through the list.

## Conclusion

Linked lists provide a more dynamic structure compared to arrays. Operations such as adding, deleting, and traversing elements are highly efficient. However, since each node requires an additional pointer, memory usage is higher.
