# Stack Data Structure

A Stack is a data structure that operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last added element is the first one to be removed. A stack allows operations only from one end, similar to adding or removing elements from the top of a physical stack.

## Basic Elements of a Stack

1. **Push (Adding):**
    - Adds an element to the stack.

2. **Pop (Removing):**
    - Removes the most recently added element from the stack.

3. **Peek (View):**
    - Retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.

4. **isEmpty (Is Empty?):**
    - Checks whether the stack is empty.

## Applications of Stack

- **Function calls and returns:** Function calls and their return values are managed using a stack in programming languages.
- **Undo/Redo operations:** Applications use stacks to manage undo and redo functionalities.
- **Expression evaluation:** Stacks help solve mathematical expressions, such as checking for balanced parentheses.
- **Web browser history:** Browsers use a stack structure to manage navigation history.

## Fundamental Stack Operations

1. **Push:** Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek:** Returns the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty:** Checks whether the stack is empty.

## Conclusion

A stack is a highly useful data structure that operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It is widely used in function calls, undo/redo operations, and many other areas. Stack operations (push, pop, peek) are fast, making this data structure efficient for solving various problems.
