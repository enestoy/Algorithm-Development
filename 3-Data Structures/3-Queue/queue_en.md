# Queue Data Structure

A Queue is a data structure that operates on the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element added is the first one to be removed. A queue works similarly to a real-life queue, where the person at the front is served first.

## Basic Elements of a Queue

1. **Enqueue (Adding):**
    - Adds an element to the queue.

2. **Dequeue (Removing):**
    - Removes an element from the queue (the first added element is removed).

3. **Peek (View):**
    - Retrieves the front element of the queue without removing it.

4. **isEmpty (Is Empty?):**
    - Checks whether the queue is empty.

5. **Size (Size):**
    - Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Applications of Queue

- **Printer queues:** Documents sent to a printer are processed in the order they were added.
- **Process scheduling:** Operating systems use queues to manage task execution.
- **Data transmission queues:** Networked systems use queues to handle data transmission sequences.

## Fundamental Queue Operations

1. **Enqueue:** Adds a new element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue:** Removes and returns the front element from the queue.
3. **Peek:** Returns the front element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty:** Checks whether the queue is empty.
5. **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Conclusion

A queue is an essential data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. It is used in scenarios where data needs to be processed in sequential order and helps maintain organization across various operations. Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek) are generally fast and efficient, making queues widely used in numerous applications and systems.
